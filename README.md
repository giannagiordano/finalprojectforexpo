### Conceptual Description

For my final project, I extended the very first sketch I made in this class, entitled "momentum." I had already created two iterations of this piece, and in the second, I tried to distill the essence of my message, which is the uncertainty about the future that I am feeling at this point in time. I initially created "momentum" as a representation of what motivates me with the intention of reminding myself to keep moving forward despite uncertainty. I expanded on this concept in my final project - choosing four other points in time that I have felt this same uncertainty to represent and reflect on and then using my past work as a representation of my current feelings in the final scene of the piece. 

My piece has five scenes. The first four scenes are as follows: 1) Costa Rica in July 2013; 2) Duke in August 2015; 3) Peru in July 2016; and 4) Spain in Spring 2018. I chose these four moments in time because I was feeling uncertain about what was to come before embarking on these experiences. Costa Rica was my first time out of the country, and I was traveling with a group of Girl Scouts from all over the world who I had never met before. I was similarly nervous about moving away from home and going to Duke in August 2015. I didn't know anyone and had chosen to go with a random roommate. In the summer of 2016, I participated in DukeEngage Peru. Although I had been out of the country before, I had never spent a full two months out of the country and I had never lived with a host family. In the spring of 2018, I studied abroad in Madrid, which also led to feelings of unease about being away from Duke for a semester, taking all classes in Spanish, and making new friends. All of these experiences pushed me out of my comfort zone and ended up being fantastic memories. I decided to include these four scenes before the representation of my current feelings to remind myself that these feelings are not new and have led me to rewarding experiences in the past.

These four scenes all have a picture that I took in the background with a filter on it. I chose this particular filter because, given the fact that this piece is deeply personal, I wanted to abstract some of the personal aspects to some extent so I feel comfortable with other users engaging with my piece. The four scenes also have an inspirational quote at the top that motivated me to partake in the experience and helped me overcome the challenges that I faced. Furthermore, these four scenes all have shapes that the user can hover over to interact with the piece. The first scene and the third scene have ellipses that match the picture in the background and are drawn with p5.scribble so that they catch the user's attention. The second scene and the fourth scene have timelines. The pop-up images in the first and third scenes are more abstract while the pop-up images in the second and fourth scenes are photographs that I have taken. Again, I tried to find a balance between abstraction and authenticity in this piece. 

The first scene is a representation of when I traveled to Costa Rica in July 2013. I represent the most important elements of my experience in an abstract way, using clipart pop-ups. When users hover over the three ellipses at the bottom of the screen, they find a group of people holding hands in a circle, a passport, and a representation of the Costa Rican flag. The image of the people holding hands represents the new relationships I formed and the passport represents that it was my first time out of the country. The Margaret Mead quote is fitting because the group spent the time accompanying a Peace Corps volunteer during her daily routine, and it was the first time I was exposed to relationship-driven service work. 

The second scene is a representation of when I came to Duke in August 2015. I created a timeline in which users can hover over the blue hearts and see pictures from each of my four years of college. The quote is fitting because I was so excited to come to Duke in order to learn more about issues that I am passionate about. 

The third scene is a representation of when I participated in DukeEngage Peru in the summer of 2016. I stayed with a host family in Cuzco, Peru and worked at an orphanage and transitional home for children. Similarly to the Costa Rica scene, I represent the most important elements of my experience using clipart pop-ups. When users hover over the three ellipses, they find a tree of handprints, a butterfly, and a representation of the Peruvian flag. The image of the tree of handprints represents a "family tree" because, by the end of the two months, I felt so close to people such as my host family, the staff at the orphanage, and the friends I made from Duke. We became so close that I consider them family. The clip-art image of the butterfly represents the freedom that I felt that summer. I had a lot of time to reflect, journal, and explore, discovering a newfound air of independence. The Mother Teresa quote is fitting because I absolutely loved my time in Peru and never thought it would be possible to come away from a two-month experience with such strong relationships. 

The fourth scene is a representation of when I studied abroad in Madrid in the spring of 2018. I created a timeline in which users can hover over the Spanish flag stars and see pictures from places to which I had the opportunity to travel that semester. The Confucius quote is fitting because I wholeheartedly embraced the opportunity to travel to new places. 

As mentioned, the fifth and final scene of this piece represents my feelings at this point in time. My feelings of uncertainty are represented by the black background, but elements such as the Martin Luther King Jr. quote, the Melinda Gates quote, and the star that moves with the mouse are motivating me to keep moving forward and working toward my goals. When the mouse is clicked, the background changes to an image of a starry night and at the top of the screen is a line of the same star clipart that is attached to the mouse. This is meant to remind me that, as has been made clear in the first four scenes, I have experienced these feelings before. In the past, "reaching for the stars" has often led to incredibly rewarding experiences and this should motivate me to keep seeking new opportunities in the future. 

I absolutely loved creating this piece, and I hope that by using scene manager, I am able to take the user on a journey with me. I hope that the story that I convey about meaningful experiences in the past and what is motivating me to keep moving forward despite uncertainty inspires others to reflect on their own "momentum," or sources of motivation. 

Finally, it's even more fitting that this piece begins with my experience in Costa Rica because, next year, I will be joining the Peace Corps in Peru. As I mentioned, my experience in Costa Rica introduced me to this organization and its relationship-driven approach to service. As I prepare for the next phase of my journey, I will hold this piece close to my heart. I'm simultaneously excited and terrified, but "momentum" is a fantastic reminder that these feelings aren't new and that I should approach my next steps with confidence.  

### Interaction Description

There are opportunities for users to interact with my piece in each of the five scenes I created. Every interactive element contributes to the conceptual message of my piece in some form. In the first and third scenes of my piece, I used p5.scribble to create three ellipses that users can hover over. I used p5.scribble because these ellipses elicit more attention than static ellipses and encourage users to explore. When users hover over the ellipses, they find clip-art pop-ups of important aspects of my experiences in Costa Rica and Peru. In the second and fourth scenes of my piece, I created timelines. In the second scene, users can hover over the blue hearts and find photographs from each of my four years at Duke. In the fourth scene, users can hover over the Spanish flag stars and see pictures from places to which I had the opportunity to travel that semester.

In the fifth scene, users can interact with the piece by moving and clicking the mouse. Depending on where the mouse is located, the quote is either Martin Luther King Jr.'s quote or Melinda Gates's quote. When the mouse is clicked, the background changes to an image of a starry night and at the top of the screen is a line of the same star clipart that is attached to the mouse. This interactive element is especially important because it represents a core concept of my piece: I have experienced this uncertainty before and I will experience this uncertainty again. 

The use of scene manager also enables the user to interact with my piece. Users can click through the scenes as quickly or as slowly as they'd like and press the BACKSPACE key at any time to return to the first scene. I think that because there are five scenes, different scenes may stand out to different users. The intended audience is anyone who is drawn in by the photography, the quotes, or the aesthetic as a whole. Above all, I hope that the conceptual and interactive elements encourage users to engage in their own reflection on what "momentum" (the piece and the common definition of the word) means to them. 

### Extension

I extended my project from the Hello World section of this course, using scene manager to amplify its conceptual message. As discussed in the "Conceptual Description," I used scene manager to create four additional scenes that represent moments in time during which I have felt uncertainty in the past but was rewarded for facing my fear. I used my previous work as the final scene in order to represent my  nervousness about the future and showcase where I am currently drawing motivation from. The extensions enable the user to get to know me better through this piece and to therefore develop more of an appreciation for my message. I hope that the extensions encourage users to reflect on their own lives. I hope that they think about if they were to create a similar piece entitled "momentum" which moments in time they would highlight.

### Drawing or Sketch of Extended Piece

### Technical Details

I used the following libraries for my project: 1) p5.js; 2 p5.scribble.js; and 3) scenemanager.js. The main library I used was p5.js. As discussed previously, I used p5.scribble.js for the ellipses in scenes one and three because the scribble ellipses draw more attention from the user than static ellipses. I used scenemanager.js to enable me to have five separate scenes. Users can click the mouse to get to the next scene and press the BACKSPACE key to get back to the first scene at any time. 

The hosting platform for my project is Github Pages. 

My code begins with a base function preload, a base function set-up, and a base function draw. The preload function loads the images used in all five scenes. The setup function creates a full screen canvas, references the SceneManager class, adds five scenes to the sketch (Animation 1-5), and calls the showNextScene function. The draw function references scene manager. Next, function mousePressed and function keyPressed enable me to use these functions to allow the user to click to the next scene and press BACKSPACE to return to the first scene. 

The first four scenes in this project use somewhat similar code to create a background and then allow for user engagement. The code for each of the scenes is written within their respective Animation functions within the this.draw function. These scenes use the POSTERIZE filter to make the background images more abstract. Here is an example from the first scene:

       //putting an image in the background
        background(costarica);
        //putting a filter on the image in the background
        filter(POSTERIZE, 3); 

 These scenes also use text arguments to display the quotes and the dates in each scene. 
 
 The interaction in the first four scenes was created with a series of if else statements using Boolean variables. After creating both Boolean variables and variables to represent the distance between the mouse and the shapes, I wrote if else statements saying, if the mouse is in close proximitiy with the points at which the shapes were created, the Boolean variable is true. If else, the Boolean variable is false. I then wrote if statements to tell the Boolean variables what to do. If true, show an image. Here is an example from the first scene:

        //creating a variable for distance 1
        let distance = dist(mouseX, mouseY, width/4, 550);

        //creating an if statement for isOverCircle interaction
        if (distance < 50)
        {
            isOverCircle = true;
        } else {
            isOverCircle = false;
        }

        //creating first circle with interaction
        if(isOverCircle == true)
        {
            image(people, width/2 - 200, height/2 - 40, people.width/3, people.height/3);
        } 
        fill(0, 99, 3);
        scribble.scribbleEllipse(width/4, 550, 60, 60);

So you get a sense of how the code is similar between scenes, here is an example from the fourth scene:

       //creating a variable for distance 14
        let distance14 = dist(mouseX, mouseY, 1050, height/2 - 60);

        //creating an if statement for isOverStar4 interaction
        if(distance14 < 100)
        {
            isOverStar4 = true;
        } else {
            isOverStar4 = false;
        }

        //creating fourth star with interaction on timeline
        if(isOverStar4 == true)
        {
            image(june, 1010, height/2 + 55, june.width/20, june.height/20);
            strokeWeight(1);
            fill("black");
            text("June", 1080, height/2 + 25, 300, 300);
        }
        image(star, 1050, height/2 - 60, star.width/6, star.height/6);

Within the Animation functions for each scene, there is also this.mousePressed function. Within this function, showNextScene is called so that users can click to the next scene: 

        //you can click to the next scene
        this.mousePressed = function()
        {
            this.sceneManager.showNextScene();
        }

The fifth scene operates a bit differently. It uses two if else statements to allow for interaction with the background and interaction with the two different quotes being highlighted.
